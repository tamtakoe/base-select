 * Based on https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch

 * This library implements Myer's diff algorithm which is generally considered to be the best general-purpose diff.
 * A layer of pre-diff speedups and post-diff cleanups surround the diff algorithm, improving both performance and output quality.
